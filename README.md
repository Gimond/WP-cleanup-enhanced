WP-cleanup-enhanced
===================

WP-cleanup-enhanced is a plugin/code snippet to clean up WordPress admin.
In this plugin I put togheter many snippets to clean up the admin part of WordPress. It was inpired by the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/selfish-fresh-start/">Selfish fresh Start plugin</a>
I did not provide an administration area, there are many plugins like adminize that do the job very well. This plugin is more oriented towards developers that don't need a wysiwyg interface, and just want to clean up there client's admin area from everything the client does not need

Usage: 
===================

This code is provided as a plugin, bug you can also copy/paste some snippets individually to your functions.php file. 
I highly commented the code, so you will just have to read and follow instructions to see what each snippet does.
